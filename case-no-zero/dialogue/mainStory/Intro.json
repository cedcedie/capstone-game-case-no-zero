	{"speaker": "Miguel", "text": "Door’s open."},
	{"speaker": "Miguel", "text": "Watch your step—mess is part of the décor."},

	{"speaker": "Celine", "text": "Figures. I half-expected to find you fossilized under your case files."},
	{"speaker": "Celine", "text": "Guess you crawled out before the archeologists got here."},

	{"speaker": "Miguel", "text": "Celine. Sharp as ever. Persistent, annoying, impossible to ignore."},
	{"speaker": "Miguel", "text": "Always chasing a story, always dragging me back into fights I swore I left behind."},

	{"speaker": "Miguel", "text": "I was reviewing… horizontally."},
	{"speaker": "Miguel", "text": "You should try it sometime."},

	{"speaker": "Celine", "text": "There’s been another one, Miguel."},
	{"speaker": "Celine", "text": "Another murder."},

	{"speaker": "Miguel", "text": "…Who?"},

	{"speaker": "Celine", "text": "Leo Mendoza. Tanod trainee. Young."},
	{"speaker": "Celine", "text": "Too young."},

	{"speaker": "Miguel", "text": "Leo… barely nineteen. Still believed the city could be saved."},
	{"speaker": "Miguel", "text": "Now he’s another report in a folder. Another kid erased."},

	{"speaker": "Miguel", "text": "I heard whispers earlier."},
	{"speaker": "Miguel", "text": "Didn’t think it was him."},

	{"speaker": "Celine", "text": "They didn’t waste time."},
	{"speaker": "Celine", "text": "They’ve already arrested someone—Erwin Santiago."},
	{"speaker": "Celine", "text": "You know him better as…"},

	{"speaker": "Miguel", "text": "…Boy Trip."},

	{"speaker": "Miguel", "text": "Erwin. A street rat, yeah—but not a killer."},
	{"speaker": "Miguel", "text": "He tried to go straight, but this city always drags people back into the gutter."},

	{"speaker": "Celine", "text": "Exactly. They’re painting him as the perfect suspect: addict, loiterer, history with the barangay."},
	{"speaker": "Celine", "text": "Too neat. Too… convenient."},

	{"speaker": "Miguel", "text": "…Celine, I said I was finished."},
	{"speaker": "Miguel", "text": "These cases chew you up. In the end, what’s left?"},
	{"speaker": "Miguel", "text": "A bitter truth no one cares about, and another body waiting for its turn."},

	{"speaker": "Celine", "text": "Maybe. But this isn’t just another case."},
	{"speaker": "Celine", "text": "This is Erwin. And you know he won’t stand a chance without you."},
	{"speaker": "Celine", "text": "If you don’t step in, no one will."},

	{"speaker": "Miguel", "text": "She’s right. Damn it."},
	{"speaker": "Miguel", "text": "I can already see the script—Erwin condemned, another scapegoat sacrificed."},
	{"speaker": "Miguel", "text": "And me pretending I didn’t see it coming."},
	{"speaker": "Miguel", "text": "Pretending I could live with it."},

	{"speaker": "Miguel", "text": "…You never give me a choice, do you?"},

	{"speaker": "Celine", "text": "Justice doesn’t wait for the well-rested."},

	{"speaker": "Miguel", "text": "…Alright, Erwin."},
	{"speaker": "Miguel", "text": "Let’s see what kind of hell you’ve stumbled into this time."}
