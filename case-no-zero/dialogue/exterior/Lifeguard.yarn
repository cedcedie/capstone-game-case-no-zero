Lifeguard: Rip currents, undertows, and overconfidence! The ocean is stronger than you think, and it doesn't give second chances. Respect the water, and it'll respect you back!

Lifeguard: Never swim alone, stay within the designated areas, and if you get tired, float on your back and wave for help! It's better to look silly than to be in serious trouble!

Lifeguard: Most rescues are just tired swimmers who got too far out. But once I had to rescue someone who was trying to teach their dog to surf. The dog was fine—the human needed help!

Lifeguard: Today's conditions are good for swimming! The water's calm, visibility is clear, and the sharks are all on their lunch break. Just kidding about the sharks—mostly!

Lifeguard: The area between the red flags is safest for swimming. If you want to snorkel, head over there where the water's shallow and the fish are friendly!
