Street Vendor: Balut! Fresh balut! 15 pesos each! Don't knock it till you try it!

-> Buy balut
    Street Vendor: Here you go! Crack it open and enjoy! It's an acquired taste, but once you like it, you'll love it!
    -> End
-> Ask about balut
    Street Vendor: It's a Filipino delicacy! Duck egg with a partially developed embryo. Sounds weird, tastes amazing!
    -> End
-> Decline
    Street Vendor: I understand! It's not for everyone. But if you're feeling adventurous, I'll be here!
    -> End
