Street Vendor: Balut! Fresh balut! 15 pesos each! Perfect for merienda!

-> Ask about balut
    Street Vendor: It's a Filipino delicacy! Duck egg with a developing embryo inside. Sounds strange, but it's actually quite tasty!
    -> End
-> Ask about the price
    Street Vendor: 15 pesos is a good price! Cheaper than the restaurants, and just as fresh. Try one, you might like it!
