    Street Vendor: What flavor would you like? I've got vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry!
    -> End
-> Ask about flavors
    Street Vendor: I make them fresh every day! The vanilla is my personal favorite - simple but perfect!
    -> End

    Street Vendor: That's fine! Ice cream is always better when you're really craving it!
