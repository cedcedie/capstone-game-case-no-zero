Street Sweeper: Another day, another pile of trash to clean up. At least the weather's nice today.

-> Keep working
    Street Sweeper: Thanks for understanding. This city won't clean itself, you know.
    -> End
-> Offer help
    Street Sweeper: That's kind of you, but I've got my routine down. Just don't litter, that's help enough!
    -> End
-> Head out
    -> End
