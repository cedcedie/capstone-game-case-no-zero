Street Vendor: Hot corn on the cob! Grilled to perfection with butter and salt! 20 pesos each!

-> Buy corn
    Street Vendor: Here's your corn! Be careful, it's hot! But that's how it tastes best!
    -> End
-> Ask about the corn
    Street Vendor: I grill it fresh all day long. The secret is keeping the heat just right!
    -> End
-> Decline
    Street Vendor: That's okay! Corn is always better when you're really hungry for it!
    -> End
