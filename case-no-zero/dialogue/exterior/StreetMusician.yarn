StreetMusician: I've been playing guitar for fifteen years, but I've only been performing on the street for three. It's scary at first, but now I can't imagine doing anything else!

StreetMusician: I love playing "Wonderwall" because everyone knows it and sings along! But my favorite is this original song I wrote about finding beauty in unexpected places!
