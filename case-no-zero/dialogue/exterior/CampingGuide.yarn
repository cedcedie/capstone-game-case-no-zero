CampingGuide: Essentials: tent, sleeping bag, water, food, and a good attitude! Everything else is just extra weight. Though I do recommend bringing marshmallowsâ€”they're nature's perfect food!

CampingGuide: The ridge trail has amazing views, but it's a tough hike. The lakeside spots are easier but more crowded. Choose your adventure level!

CampingGuide: Always tell someone where you're going, bring a first aid kit, and remember: if you're lost, stay put! The search party will find you faster than you'll find your way back!
