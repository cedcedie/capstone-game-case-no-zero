Gravedigger: This is sacred work, you know. Every grave I dig is someone's final resting place, and I make sure it's done with respect and dignity.

-> Ask about the work
    Gravedigger: It's not the most cheerful job, but someone has to do it. I take pride in doing it right.
        -> How long have you been doing this?
            <<jump GraveExperience>>
        -> Is it difficult work?
            <<jump GraveDifficulty>>
        -> That's admirable
            <<jump Gravedigger>>
-> Ask about the cemetery
    Gravedigger: This place has been here for over a hundred years. Every stone tells a story, every grave holds memories.
        -> Any interesting stories?
            <<jump GraveStories>>
        -> How do you maintain it?
            <<jump GraveMaintenance>>
        -> It's peaceful here
            <<jump Gravedigger>>

Gravedigger: Twenty years now. I've dug graves for babies and centenarians, for rich and poor. Death is the great equalizer, and I help ensure everyone gets the same dignity.

Gravedigger: Once, a family asked me to bury their pet dog next to their grandmother. Said the dog was her best friend. I did it—love is love, whether it's human or animal.

Gravedigger: I keep the grass trimmed, the stones clean, and the paths clear. It's like tending a garden, but instead of flowers, I'm caring for memories.
