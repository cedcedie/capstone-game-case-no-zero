BarberShopOwner: Fifty pesos for a cut, seventy-five if you want the full treatment. That includes a shave so smooth you'll forget you ever had a beard!

BarberShopOwner: I can do anything from a simple trim to a full style. Your hair, your choice. Though I must warn you, I'm terrible at mohawks—they always end up looking like confused roosters!

BarberShopOwner: Oh, I've heard everything in this chair. People talk when they're relaxed. Once had a customer confess to stealing his neighbor's mangoes while I was trimming his sideburns!
