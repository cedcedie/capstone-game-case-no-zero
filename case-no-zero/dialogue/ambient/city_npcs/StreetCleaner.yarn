StreetCleaner: Clean streets, clean conscience. Someone's got to keep this city looking good.

-> Ask about the work
    StreetCleaner: It's honest work. Early mornings, steady pace, and the satisfaction of seeing progress.
        -> Is it hard work?
            <<jump CleanerHard>>
        -> How long have you been doing this?
            <<jump CleanerLong>>
-> Offer help
    StreetCleaner: That's kind of you, but I've got my routine. Appreciate the thought though.
        -> You do important work
            <<jump CleanerImportant>>
        -> Stay safe
            <<jump CleanerSafe>>
-> I'll get out of your way
    -> End
