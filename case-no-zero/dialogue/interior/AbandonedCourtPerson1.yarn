Abandoned Court Person: This place has seen better days. The court has been abandoned for years, but some of us still come here for various reasons.

-> Ask about the court
    Abandoned Court Person: This used to be a busy courthouse, but it's been closed for a long time. Now it's mostly empty and forgotten.
        -> Why was it abandoned?
            <<jump AbandonedCourtWhy1>>
        -> What do you do here?
            <<jump AbandonedCourtDo1>>
        -> That's interesting
            <<jump AbandonedCourtPerson1>>
-> Ask about the area
    Abandoned Court Person: This area used to be the center of legal activity in the city. Now it's quiet and mostly ignored by most people.
        -> Is it safe here?
            <<jump AbandonedCourtSafe1>>
        -> Do many people come here?
            <<jump AbandonedCourtPeople1>>
        -> That's sad
            <<jump AbandonedCourtPerson1>>
-> Just saying hi
    Abandoned Court Person: Be careful if you're exploring. This place isn't as safe as it used to be.
    -> End

Abandoned Court Person: The building became too old and expensive to maintain. They built a new courthouse elsewhere and left this one to decay.

Abandoned Court Person: It's not as safe as it used to be. The building is deteriorating, and there are some unsavory characters who sometimes hang around.
