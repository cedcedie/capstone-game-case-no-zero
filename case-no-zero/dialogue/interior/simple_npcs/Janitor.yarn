Janitor: Just keeping things clean around here. A clean building is a happy building, that's what I always say.

-> Ask about the work
    Janitor: It's honest work. I take pride in keeping this place spotless. People notice when things are clean.
    -> End
-> Comment on cleanliness
    Janitor: Thanks! I do my best. It's not glamorous work, but someone's got to do it, and I don't mind.
    -> End
-> Head out
    -> End
