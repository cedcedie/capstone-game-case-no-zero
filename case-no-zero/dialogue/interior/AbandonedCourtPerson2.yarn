Abandoned Court Person: This courthouse has been abandoned for years. It's a shadow of what it used to be, but some of us still find reasons to come here.

-> Ask about the history
    Abandoned Court Person: This place used to be bustling with legal activity. Now it's just an empty shell of its former self.
        -> What was it like when it was active?
            <<jump AbandonedCourtActive2>>
        -> When did it close?
            <<jump AbandonedCourtClose2>>
        -> That's sad
            <<jump AbandonedCourtPerson2>>
-> Ask about the present
    Abandoned Court Person: Now it's mostly empty and forgotten. The building is deteriorating, and most people avoid this area.
        -> Why do you still come here?
            <<jump AbandonedCourtWhy2>>
        -> Is it dangerous?
            <<jump AbandonedCourtDangerous2>>
        -> That's concerning
            <<jump AbandonedCourtPerson2>>
-> Just saying hi
    Abandoned Court Person: Be careful if you're exploring. This place isn't what it used to be.
    -> End

Abandoned Court Person: It closed about ten years ago when they built the new courthouse. This one was too old and expensive to maintain.

Abandoned Court Person: It can be, especially at night. The building is unstable in places, and there are sometimes unsavory people around.
