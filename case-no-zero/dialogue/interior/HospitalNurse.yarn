HospitalNurse: Long night. The monitor beeps start to sound like lullabies.

-> How’s the shift?
    HospitalNurse: Busy. Small victories matter.
        -> What counts as a win?
            <<jump NurseShift>>
        -> How do you stay steady?
            <<jump NurseCoping>>
-> Need anything?
    HospitalNurse: Kindness. And maybe a chair that doesn’t squeak.
        -> Offer coffee
            HospitalNurse: Bless you. Warm hands, warmer heart.
            <<jump HospitalNurse>>
        -> Offer silence
            HospitalNurse: That too. Quiet makes room for breath.
            <<jump HospitalNurse>>
-> I’ll leave you to it
    -> End
